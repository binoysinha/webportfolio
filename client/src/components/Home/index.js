					My journey as web developer begins seven years ago. From showing a simple <code>{'{{hello world}} '}</code>
					text on browser to developing complex web application aptly defined my growth as a developer.
				</p>
				<p>
					My passion and love for Javascript enabled me to move to backend development also and these days exploring ML
					using Javascript. For me coding is a hobby, and like building stuffs for the web. I firmly believe that
					learning is a lifelong process. I spent more times on Udemy than on Netflix.
				</p>
				<p>
					I don't restrict myself to tech space only. I have keen interest in world affairs from politics to environment
					and whats happening in and around us.
