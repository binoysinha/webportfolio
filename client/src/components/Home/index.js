						<p>
							My journey as a web application developer began seven years ago. From showing a simple
							<code>{'{{hello world}} '}</code>
							text on browser to developing complex web application, aptly defines my growth as a developer.
						</p>
						<p>
							I have experience in building both large e-commerce applications as well as enterprise applications. For
							me coding is a hobby and building stuff for the web is a passion. I firmly believe that learning is a
							lifelong process. I have a passion for understanding things at a fundamental level and sharing it as
							clearly as possible.
						</p>
						<p>
							I don't restrict myself to tech space only. I have keen interest in world affairs from politics to
							environment and whats happening in and around us. Whenever, I am in holiday mode, I take out my bike and
							go out for long drive.
